# ScholarshipManagement

Welcome to our Scholarship Management System, there are a few things you should know when you clone, and those are:

* Run python manage.py makemigrations

* Run python manage.py migrate (It contains default data so you have something to start with)

The users are:

| Email | Password | Acces to |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| admin@gmail.com | ADMIN | Scholarships - Announcements - Roles - Reports |
| financial@gmail.com | FINANCIAL | Applicants |
| philanthropy@gmail.com | PHILANTHROPY | Scholarships - Announcement - Reports |
| default@gmail.com | DEFAULT | Nothing ;D |

Hope you find what you expected for in our project!
