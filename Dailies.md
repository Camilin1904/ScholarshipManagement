Sup, it's Andrés Camilo Romero Ruiz, leader of the group, and i'm here to leave a message:

Before starting the dailies I've been working in parallel on the following to advance the development of the project:

HTML and CSS development, I have advanced in the implementation of the page:
* Home from the admin view, functionalities still need to be assigned but the CSS part it's probably fully designed.
* Login, is fully designed but i've been working on features
* Signin, it is fully designed and functional. However I think it will be discarded during the project
* Search, is partially designed and has no functionality

Icon Selection: create the icons folder and add the ones I have used so far in the CSS

Django: I have been working on ways like creating user, login, filter, enumerations for calls and I have been working on data modeling for users

All of this work will be uploaded in the daily files as a zip, since they're outdated for the actual branches, but they're going to be used and might be uploaded latter in commits with different names ;D

## 21/09/2023

| Name | What did you do yesterday? | What will you do today? | Are there any impediments in your way? |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Juan Camilo Salazar |  I made the "announcement creation" view visible on the page and included the link in the base view  | I will extend the information requested in the form displayed in the "announcement creation" view | No |
| Camilo Carmona Valencia | I was unable to link the tables because of my academic situation | I will link the tables | Partial exams |
| Andrés Camilo Romero | I discover that probably it would be better if I use the integrated parts of django since it contains methods to authenticate the users and group them based on the permissions they have | I will keep on searching on how to use them with my own user class or if it's needed to inherit them from the user class that django offers | Python documentation is kind of confusing compare to java so I will try and search in other sites about it. And also exams |
| Juan Sebastián Libreros | unfortunately my disease got worse and I wasn't able to work properly, even though I solved a git problem and understood more about how the python django framework works for making the modify function of my User Story. Also I pushed my branch into the repository | I will do my best to create the and advance on my duty of making the function of modify state | I'm sick, but it's a minor issue|
| Brayan Steven Ortega | I was unable to continue creating the base view | I will link the base view of the creation/addition of an applicant with the home page | Partial exams |
