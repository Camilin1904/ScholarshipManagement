Sup, it's Andr√©s Camilo Romero Ruiz, leader of the group, and i'm here to leave a message:

Before starting the dailies I've been working in parallel on the following to advance the development of the project:

HTML and CSS development, I have advanced in the implementation of the page:
* Home from the admin view, functionalities still need to be assigned but the CSS part it's probably fully designed.
* Login, is fully designed but i've been working on features
* Signin, it is fully designed and functional. However I think it will be discarded during the project
* Search, is partially designed and has no functionality

Icon Selection: create the icons folder and add the ones I have used so far in the CSS

Django: I have been working on ways like creating user, login, filter, enumerations for calls and I have been working on data modeling for users

All of this work will be uploaded in the daily files as a zip, since they're outdated for the actual branches, but they're going to be used and might be uploaded latter in commits with different names ;D
